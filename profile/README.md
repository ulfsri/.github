# UL's Fire Safety Research Institute

UL’s Fire Safety Research Institute [(FSRI)](https://FSRI.org) advances fire safety knowledge to address the world’s unresolved fire safety risks and emerging dangers. As part of the UL Research Institutes [(ul.org)](https://ul.org), we are committed to sharing our fire safety insights with everyone to provide safe living and working environments for people everywhere. 

Through advanced fire science, rigorous research, extensive outreach and education in collaboration with our international network of partners, we impart stakeholders with the information, tools and resources that enable them to make better, more fire-safe decisions that ultimately save lives and property.
